# ðŸ““Notepad--

The application is implemented on the Windows Forms platform.

The project is written for educational purposes.

The application is written personally for me to take notes of classes. Unlike a regular notepad, colors and different fonts can be used in this application. But at the same time my application is not too complicated like MS Word(my app opens faster and has more space for text). And the most important thing is that if I'm missing something, then I can write it quickly.

The application can open 3 types of files: rtf, png, txt. It was created mainly to work with rtf files. The png format is needed so that you can save some diagram or table from the video tutorial. The txt format is supported because I used to write notes in a notebook. It is possible to open all files from a folder or insert an image from the clipboard.

This branch is the only one so far. In the process of using it, I realized that a design like notepad++ (with tabs on top) is not really needed, since I usually work with a single file. It is also inconvenient that you cannot use pictures in notes (not in separate files). So maybe in the future I will redo the design.
